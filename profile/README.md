## Course Name: `Machine Leanring 1 : IEMLabs`

### About
Computer vision and Artificial Intelligence has influenced many domains like mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. But still cameras don't have any moral sense. CCTV cameras don't trigger an alarm if it sees someone drowning or detecting gun violence etc. This course will start with the basic algorithms, understanding mathematics behind these algorithms on the way and end up implementing end-to-end models for these tasks : image classification, localization and detection using Python. It is mainly focused on solving your doubts and evoke rational questions on the way. Feel free to shoot me with your all creative questions relevant to this course at Discussion/Questions ðŸ’¡. <br></br>
**`*`The course Assignments and discussion tab is only available for enrolled students.**
